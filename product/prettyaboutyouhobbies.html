    <p>I love playing video games, especially FPS/First Person Shooter games.
    Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is my current favorite, but I also play
    Destiny 2, Rainbow Six Siege, and Call of Duty: Black Ops. When I am
    looking to goof around, I play Dead by Daylight. I am horrible at that
    game, so it is fun to see how fast I fail. I also find it hilarious when
    games glitch. It cracks me up because I know how easy it can be for coding
    and technological problems to occur. At the top of the page, there is a
    link to Steam if you want to game like me.</p>

    <p>Another hobby of mine is spending time outside with my dog. He loves
    the outdoors. I take him to the dog park where he thinks all other dogs
    and humans want to be his friend. This is great until he gets so excited
    that he jumps up and almost tackles these innocent beings. We're working
    on his training still.</p>
