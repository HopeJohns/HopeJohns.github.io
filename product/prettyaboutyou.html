    <p>I am the youngest of seven kids, and I have a lot of nerdy older siblings.
    I was born and raised in Lake of the Ozarks, and I still live here even when
    the tourists block all of the traffic. I have a dog named Odin, and he is my
    world. He is a husky/pitbull mix who LOVES water. My favorite color is black,
    my favorite number is nine, and my favorite music is rock.</p>

    <p>I have taken the introductory courses for programming here at OTC and took
    my first applications and Java courses at Missouri State University a couple
    of years ago. I am in C# with Professor Riley right now, and I will be taking
    four programming courses through OTC in the fall.</p>

    <p>I took an interest in this degree because of the creativity and freedom
    I saw when programmers were set to a task. There is something special about
    being able to not only put a puzzle together, but also create the pieces.</p>
